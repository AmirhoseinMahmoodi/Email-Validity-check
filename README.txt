This is a program developed in C programming language, that checks the validity of an Email address if it was valid the expression "Email is valid" would be written
on the command-line otherwise "Wrong input.Try again:" would be what user sees.

The process checks all specifications of a valid Email address which is:
(
  1.There have to be only one "@" .
  2.The prefix part of the domain mustn't start with a number.
  3.The Email address should contain only one dot(.) after the At sign(@)
  4.Between the Atsign and the single dot its necessary to have a phrase (in this program the only acceptable phrases are "gmail" & "yahoo" which leads the program to only accept Gmail and yahoomail as valid Emails).
  5.After the dot there you have to have the exact phrase "com".
)
